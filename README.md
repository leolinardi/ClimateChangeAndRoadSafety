# ClimateChangeAndRoadSafety
A project from Elements of Data Processing subject that analyses the correlation of climate change and road safety of real datasets using python.

Involves finding the Pearson Correlation, Mutual Information, and using techniques of Principal Component Analysis, K-Means clustering, K-NN prediction to analyze the data.

The findings are presented using tables and visualized through a heatmap, line graph and scatter plots.

The findings report can be found [here](https://github.com/leolinardi/ClimateChangeAndRoadSafety/blob/master/climate-change-and-road-safety-report.pdf).
